#TypeScript Sample Project

[http://www.typescriptlang.org/](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript aims to help you develop robust and complex JavaScript applications by adding numerous features. 

The clients don't have to use custom module or plugin: TypeScript is **compiled** in JavaScript. In this project all the .js files under /Scripts folder are auto-generated by the compiler.

In TypeScript you can use:
- Classes & Inheritence
- Interfaces
- Generics
- Type inference & compile-time type check
- Modules
- "this" capture
- Lambda
- Powerfull Visual Studio IntelliSense 
... and many more
